# Object Detection in an Urban Environment

## Project overview
This section should contain a brief description of the project and what we are trying to achieve. Why is object detection such an important component of self driving car systems?

## Set up
This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.

## Dataset
For this project, we will be using data from the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/).

### Dataset analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts and other visualizations.
### Cross validation
